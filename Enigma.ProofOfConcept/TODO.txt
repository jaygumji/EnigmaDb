-----------------------------------------
-- To be done
-----------------------------------------

The main db files will be simple entry lists. Still divided in sections to provide possibility of truncating deleted entries.
	Treat the primary id as another index, makes it searchable

Text Search algorithm

Standalone service
	Includes generation of proxy classes at runtime

Indexes needs a rework
	The current memory part of the indexes is not very efficient

Enable modelbuilding when the connection changes

-----------------------------------------
-- Work in progress
-----------------------------------------

Protobuf will be removed as dependency, it will be using my own serialization engine instead
	The main reason being, I wanted to make my own serialization engine, purely for fun

Ability to add jobs that runs at a scheduled time
Predefined jobs
	Maintainance job that truncates database at night and rebuilds indexes

Acknowledge EnigmaDbSet at model building
